# PlanEat
PlanEat is a fantastic platform where users can get a hand in the daily stress of thinking what to eat. With PlanEat you can:
* Browse cooking recipes
* Plan weekly menus with your favorite recipes
* Buy your grocieries for the planned menú
The best of this is that you can do it all in a single place!

PlanEat is a basic clone of ComoQuiero[https://www.comoquiero.net], and is being developed as my final project of the Bootcamp 'Fullstack Developer - Ruby on Rails'
